# Weather Analytics Power BI Dashboard
Real-Time Weather, AQI & Forecast Insights

# Project
Weather Analytics: A Power BI dashboard built to analyze real-time weather conditions and air quality data using live API integration. The project focuses on transforming raw weather data into clear, interactive visuals that are easy to explore and understand.

# Description
This dashboard allows users to monitor critical environmental metrics like temperature trends, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, UV Index, Precipitation, Sunrise, Sunset and Air Quality Index (AQI) across global cities. It serves as a functional weather monitor.

# Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- Power BI Desktop - Used for building the report and interactive visuals
- Power Query (M Query) - Handles API calls, data extraction, and transformations
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, KPIs, and conditional formatting
- WeatherAPI – Source for real-time and forecast weather data
- File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview

# Data Source
Source: WeatherAPI

The dashboard pulls live weather data through API requests and structures it into the following components:
- Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure
- Weather condition descriptions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Air Quality Index (AQI) values with categorical labels
- Location-based weather data (city and State level)
- Short-term forecast trends for temperature and conditions

# Features & Highlights
Weather and air quality data are often available only as raw numbers or static reports, making it difficult to quickly understand trends or compare conditions across locations. Interpreting AQI levels and short-term weather changes can be especially challenging without clear visual context.

The goal of this project was to build a clean and interactive dashboard that:
- Combines real-time weather and AQI data in one place
- Makes weather trends easy to interpret visually
- Demonstrates practical use of APIs in Power BI

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Key KPIs
Displays real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and AQI status using card visuals.

Weather Overview Panel
Shows current weather conditions for the selected location in a simple, readable format.

AQI Indicator
Highlights air quality levels (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.) using conditional formatting.

Forecast Trend Visuals
Line charts display temperature trends to show short-term weather changes.

Location Filters
Slicers allow users to switch between cities and countries dynamically.

UI Design
A minimal, glassmorphism-inspired layout focused on readability and user experience.
